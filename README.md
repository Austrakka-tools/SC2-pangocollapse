# SC2-pangocollapse

For national reporting of SARS-CoV-2 lineages Austrakka utilises a two-step process involving [pango-collapse](https://github.com/MDU-PHL/pango-collapse).

1. The initial `pango-collapse` is run with the default file found [here](https://github.com/MDU-PHL/pango-collapse/blob/main/pango_collapse/collapse.txt)
2. An additional `pango-collapse` is also run with a custom file, to address the needs of national reporting in Australia, found here in this repository.

This file is maintained by the Austrakka National Analysis Team.
